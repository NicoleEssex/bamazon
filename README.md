NodeJS &amp; MySQL application.

This is a node application that pulls information from a MySql database and based on user choices also updates the MySql database to reflect any changes. All information stored in the database is hardcoded. This application is meant to show how specific database information can be pulled from user requests and also updated to reflect current changes made from users actions.  I've included an html document with screen shots of both the node application interaction with the user and how those actions retrieve, compare, and update in the MySql database.
